# GAME-ROUTINE - DETAILED INFO 

    Thank you for joining our open Beta!

    After opening the login-scene, please enter your desired Username - after that you need to press the "Join Lobby" button, and a new lobby-screen opens up.
    Here you can choose your robot - if it is already taken its button should be disabled (grey-coloured/not clickable).
    Before choosing the bot you can already start chatting with the other players in the lobby

    -- if you want to play with AI, just type /addAI into the lobby-Chat - it will chose its robot automatically. If you want to add more AIs, just repeat the command.
    
    After you made your decision, you can press the ready button to set your status to ready/unready(it will be filled pink when you are ready, filled black with a pink frame when you are not)
    If you were the first one to ready up, the map choices appear on the bottom third of your lobby-scene.
    You can now click on the Map you want to choose, and afterwards press the "choose-map" button to start the game. 
    It takes at least two players to start the game, but since there is the AI from the beginning, you can also start the game right away wwithout any other real player.

    After "choose-map" was pressed, a new main-screen opens.
    The next step for you is to chose the starting point you prefer by pressing on one of the white circles on the map
    If everyone has chosen their startingpoints, you can decide if you want to buy the upgrade card that appears in the upgrade shop on the left, or not.   
        Even if you dont want to buy it, you need to press the "upgrade" button (without clicking on the upgrade card) so that you get sent your hand cards.
    
    After receiving the hand cards, you can easily fill your register by clicking the card from your hand that you want to play first -> it is gonna be sent to the first free register
    Same goes for the rest of the five register cards - if you want to remove a card from your register, just click on it and it will be sent back to your hand.

    After the register is completely filled with all five cards for every player, the game enters the next phase - the ActivationPhase.
    Now all the cards get activated for each register. The robots should start moving. 



    Please keep in mind this is a BETA and there are going to be multiple bugs - feel free to test everything - we appreciate your feedback!
